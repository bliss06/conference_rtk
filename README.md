I thought there wont be much instruction for conference planner task, so I started on my own to create a project from scratch. I finished landing page and added navigation after many trial & error approach. Got it right in a way, then noticed that there are further lab instructions to complete the project. That project is "Conference event planner" and I will clone and start with that. Applying from scratch, concepts that are not explained is taking lot of time.
